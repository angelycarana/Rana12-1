				<h2> LE COUCHER DU SOLEIL </h2>
				<p> Sunsets are very fascinating, it melts my heart every time I witness this wonderful creation. Although the sun is going down it still capture the attention of my eyes to look and stare. By witnessing the beauty and awe of the sunset, you can slow down your perception of time. When we relegate the experience of sunsets to vacations and special occasions, we feel the urge to document, capture and save them -as if hoarding photos of their majesty will help us remember that wondrous feeling.</p>

		<h3> SUNSET </h3>
		<p> Sunsets prooves that endings are always the best part.A large drop of sun lingered on the horizon and then dripped over and was gone, and the sky was brilliant over the spot where it had gone, and a torn cloud, like a bloody rag, hung over the spot of its going. And dusk crept over the sky from the eastern horizon, and darkness crept over the land from the east. </p>
